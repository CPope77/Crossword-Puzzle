# Crossword-Puzzle
	This is a program I implementedin Python. It looks similar to any other crossword puzzle you would find. The game prompts the user with four choices. They can guess a word, show the grid, show a clue, or quit the game. It reads the information from a text file for a list of all the words and the corresponding box number, direction, and clue for the word. When you choose to get a clue, you simply tell the program the box number and the direction, and the program gives you the correct clue. If you wish to guess the word, do the same as before, and plug in the number and direction. If you guess the word correctly, the program will fill the grid with the word. This program uses multiple function that work with each other to fulfill the correct function of the game. I included a capture of what the grid looks like without any words in it. The capture is in the Crossword-Puzzle portfolio.
